# R_Shiny_Chicago_Crime

  For a class assignment, I created a Shiny app that provides an interactive visualization of some important features of a publicly available Chicago crime data set. This Shiny app has 4 tabs:
  1) Select which month and which crime types you would like to see crime frequencies for
  2) Select which location you would like to see crime frequencies for
  3) Heatmap that depicts crime frequency by hour of the day, by crime type
  4) Select a date range and visualize on a map crime locations. Hover over the balloons to see the date/time, type, crime description and location description
